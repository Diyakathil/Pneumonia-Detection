# Pneumonia Detection using CNN & AlexNet

This project uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and AlexNet architecture to detect pneumonia from chest X-ray images.

## 📁 Dataset
The dataset was downloaded from [Kaggle's Chest X-Ray Images (Pneumonia)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia).

## 📌 Models Used
- CNN (custom architecture)
- AlexNet (adapted for binary classification)

## 🛠️ Tools
- Google Colab
- TensorFlow / Keras
- Matplotlib, NumPy, Pandas

## 🚀 Output
Achieved high accuracy in detecting pneumonia from image data.

## 💡 How to Run
Upload the dataset into Colab and run the `.ipynb` notebook cells sequentially.
